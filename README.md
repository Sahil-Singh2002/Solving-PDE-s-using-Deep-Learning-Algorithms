# Solving PDE's using Deep-Learning Algorithms

 Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in high-dimensional domains are common in fields like finance, quantum mechanics, and uncertainty quantification. Traditional methods for solving these PDEs are computationally expensive. Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been identified as a promising alternative for solving high-dimensional PDEs efficiently. This project focuses on studying and implementing deep-learning algorithms for numerically approximating high-dimensional variational PDEs.
